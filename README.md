# RTOS Based Smart Home (AVR)

This project showcases a smart home system built using the AVR ATmega32 microcontroller. It consists of two versions:

1. **RTOS-Based Version**: Utilizes a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for enhanced task management and responsiveness.
2. **Simple Version**: A straightforward implementation without the use of an RTOS.

Explore both versions to see the differences in architecture and functionality!
